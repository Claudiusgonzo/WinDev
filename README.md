# Windows Developers' Issues

## Welcome to the Windows Developer (WinDev) Issues repo!

The purpose of this repo is to collect and catalog issues that affect / impact developers who work on Windows. It doesn't matter if you're developing applications FOR Windows or applications that you plan to deploy on Linux, Android, IoT devices, servers, containers, or cloud - if you're building code ON Windows, we'd love to hear from you.

## Scope of this repo
Please take note of the current scope of this repo. 

### In Scope

At present __we are only accepting Windows 10 performance-related issues for developers__. 

### Out of scope

We cannot help you with your coding homework, we cannot help you open a broken Word document, and we cannot help you up your Halo game. We can only help you with subjects in-scope. Sorry! ðŸ˜œ

> In the future, we may broaden our scope to accept issues relating to other issue-areas, but we are carefully scoping the types of issues we can accept, while we build our skills and processes to triage and handle incoming issues


### Other ways to submit feedback
If you have any other feedback, please submit via Windows 10's [Feedback Hub](feedback-hub) app which will route you to the team most closely related to the subject of your feedback.
